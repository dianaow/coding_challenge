# Coding Challenge

Task: Write an application that finds the 3 longest unique palindromes in any supplied string. For the 3
longest palindromes, report the palindrome, start index and length, in descending order of length.

Given the input string: sqrrqabccbatudefggfedvwhijkllkjihxymnnmzpop , the output should be:
* Text: hijkllkjih, Index: 23, Length: 10
* Text: defggfed, Index: 13, Length: 8
* Text: abccba, Index: 5 Length: 6

Solution is written in Python language.

To run the code:

1. Download the file find_palindrome.py
2. In the terminal, make the script executable, using the following command: 
`chmod +x find_palindromes.py`
3. Run the python function with the following command: 
`python -c 'import find_palindromes; palindrome("sqrrqabccbatudefggfedvwhijkllkjihxymnnmzpop")`
4. Change string input in the function and run again.
